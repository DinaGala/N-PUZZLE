def a_star(heuristic, field, goal, goal_state, size, g_weight = 1, h_weight = 1):
    """
    Implements the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial puzzle state to the goal.
    A* uses a cost function f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where:
    - g(n) is the cost to reach node n from the start (actual cost),
    - h(n) is the estimated cost from node n to the goal (heuristic).

    Steps:
    1. Initialize the following data structures:
       - `open_set`: a priority queue containing nodes to explore, ordered by their f-costs.
       - `closed_set`: a set of already-explored nodes.
       - `g_cost`: maps each state to the cost of reaching it from the start.
       - `came_from`: maps each node to its predecessor (for path reconstruction).
       - `open_set_lookup`: mirrors the open set, allowing for efficient f-cost comparison.
       - `nb_state`, `max_state`: track time and space complexity.

    2. Begin with the initial state:
       - Set g = 0 and compute its f = g + h.
       - Add it to the priority queue.

    3. Main loop:
       - Pop the node with the lowest f-cost from the open set.
       - Mark it as visited and update memory tracking.
       - If this node is the goal, exit the loop.

    4. For each neighbor of the current node:
       - Skip it if already visited.
       - Compute tentative g and f costs.
       - If this path to the neighbor is better than any previously recorded:
           - Update its g-cost and path.
           - Add it to the open set if it's not already scheduled, or if it now has a better f-cost.

    5. Continue until the goal state is reached or the open set is exhausted.

    Finally, the algorithm prints:
    - Number of moves to reach the goal.
    - Number of states expanded (time complexity).
    - Maximum states in memory at any point (space complexity).
    - The full solution path from start to goal.
